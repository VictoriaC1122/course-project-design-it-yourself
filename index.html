        <h2>Course Project Proposal｜Visual Material Interaction Platform</h2>
        <p>
          This page presents the English version of the project proposal,
          structured into Situation, Problems, and Solution for teaching and portfolio use.
        </p>

      <div class="content-block">
        <h3>1. Situation</h3>
        <p>
          This project aims to address the challenges currently faced by homeowners, architectural firms,
          and material suppliers in the process of building material selection. By developing an integrated
          material platform, the project seeks to enhance communication efficiency, pricing transparency,
          and immediacy in design decision-making.
        </p>
        <p>
          At present, homeowners primarily rely on materials provided by architectural firms, which limits
          their selection options. If they wish to use materials from non-partner suppliers, they must
          engage in additional negotiations, often resulting in unclear pricing and a lengthy process.
          Furthermore, homeowners cannot intuitively perceive how selected materials influence the atmosphere
          of a space until the firm produces a 3D rendering, which leads to repeated revisions and time delays.
        </p>
        <p>
          For architectural firms, clients often struggle to visualize how materials will look in real space,
          resulting in multiple design adjustments and increased labor and communication costs.
        </p>
        <p>
          For material suppliers, collaboration typically requires visiting each firm individually to promote
          their products, making it difficult for smaller or lesser-known brands to enter the market.
        </p>
        <p>
          To address these issues, this project proposes the development of a Visual Material Interaction
          Platform. The platform integrates a comprehensive material database with a simplified design
          simulation tool. Architectural firms can input floor plans and elevation data to generate a basic
          spatial model, allowing homeowners to directly experiment with and replace materials within the
          platform. Users can immediately preview how each material affects the overall atmosphere of the space,
          which helps reduce last-minute changes, shorten design timelines, and improve decision-making efficiency.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, the platform enhances price transparency and provides material suppliers with a unified
          channel for exposure and collaboration, fostering a more balanced and competitive market. Ultimately,
          this project aims to create a visualized decision-making ecosystem that integrates the needs of
          homeowners, architectural firms, and material suppliers, promoting a more efficient, transparent,
          and interactive process for material selection.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Problems</h3>
        <p>
          At present, there are various solutions in the market that attempt to address the problem of
          “enabling consumers to quickly and accurately preview how building materials will appear in real spaces
          while integrating supplier and pricing information.” However, each of these solutions has limitations
          and has not fully addressed our target pain points:
        </p>
        <p><strong>1. Professional Interior Design Services</strong></p>
        <p>
          These services provide customized designs and high-quality renderings, but they are often costly and
          require a long discussion and confirmation process with professional designers. Furthermore, after the
          designer produces a rendering, if clients wish to use materials that are not available through the
          designer’s affiliated firms, either the designer or the client must coordinate with material suppliers,
          which increases the cost communication and extends the procurement process.
        </p>
        <p><strong>2. Traditional 3D Modeling and Rendering Software (AutoCAD, 3ds Max, etc.)</strong></p>
        <p>
          These professional tools can produce highly realistic results, but they have steep learning curves and
          complex operations, making them hard to be familiar with and suitable only for professionals or users
          with architectural backgrounds. For general homeowners or clients without design experience, these
          options are less user-friendly and cannot directly address issues related to material procurement.
        </p>
        <p><strong>3. Reference Photos or Samples Provided by Developers or Suppliers</strong></p>
        <p>
          The photos or samples provided by material suppliers can showcase textures, but their appearances vary
          significantly under different lighting conditions, photography settings, or scene arrangements. As a
          result, it is difficult to accurately predict how the materials will appear once installed in the actual
          space. Additionally, this approach cannot simulate how materials integrate with existing spatial elements,
          requiring extensive imagination and trial-and-error.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although consumer-oriented platforms such as Houzz and IKEA offer AR or visualization features that
          provide the “instant preview”, they primarily focus on furniture and soft furnishings. Their applications
          remain limited when it comes to systemized hard-material selection for interior finishes.
        </p>
        <p><strong>4. Generative AI Image Simulation (e.g., DALL·E, Midjourney)</strong></p>
        <p>
          Generative AI can rapidly produce conceptual visuals or atmosphere mock-ups. However, the AI-generated
          images frequently contain layout inconsistencies, material mapping errors, and mismatched details.
          Moreover, these visuals cannot be directly linked to real-world product specifications, making this
          method only valuable in offering a rapid visualization, while its feasibility as a practical
          design-assistance tool remains limited.
        </p>
        <p>
          Based on the above observations, the common shortcomings among existing solutions can be summarized as follows:
        </p>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>(1) They are not user-friendly for general homeowners without architectural or design backgrounds,
              due to high technical or cost barriers.</li>
          <li>(2) Most solutions still require clients or designers to independently identify and coordinate with
              material suppliers, leading to complex and time-consuming workflows.</li>
          <li>(3) Current options are either expensive and time-intensive, or fast but lacking in precision and
              supplier information.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These gaps define the core value of our proposed Visual Material Interaction Platform, which integrates
          a comprehensive material supplier database with real-time visualization and price display. The platform
          aims to reduce client burden, shorten decision-making time, and directly connect visual outcomes with
          purchasable material data—effectively bridging the disconnection and inefficiencies that exist within
          current market solutions.
        </p>

        <h3>3. Solution</h3>
        <p>
          This project proposes the Visual Material Interaction Platform—an integrated digital ecosystem that
          combines a comprehensive material database, real-time 3D rendering, and transparent pricing—to bridge
          architectural firms, homeowners, and material suppliers and enable intuitive, participatory material
          selection. The platform operates in two complementary modes.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the <strong>Professional Import Mode</strong>, architectural firms upload CAD/BIM models or floor plans,
          and homeowners log in to explore those models, replacing or adjusting finishes such as flooring and wall
          treatments while the system instantly updates visual renderings, pricing, and product details. This keeps
          designers’ workflows intact while making material discussions visual, efficient, and data-driven.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the <strong>Independent Design Mode</strong>, DIY users start from their own floor plans or built-in
          templates and, through drag-and-drop, paint-like tools, freely combine materials while receiving real-time
          3D previews and estimated cost breakdowns, thereby democratizing design participation without professional
          barriers.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the core is a nationwide material repository that consolidates specifications (e.g., texture, dimensions,
          sustainability indicators), high-fidelity textures and 3D mappings, cross-supplier price information, and
          user reviews and ratings. By presenting supplier data in a single interface, the platform reduces market
          fragmentation and elevates the visibility of smaller brands.
        </p>
        <p>
          The real-time 3D engine allows users to preview combinations under adjustable lighting and spatial contexts;
          every substitution automatically synchronizes with an updated budget, promoting evidence-based decisions and
          minimizing post-design revisions.
        </p>
        <p>
          The platform further supports transparent, collaborative decision-making: homeowners can see, compare, and
          decide on their own terms; firms reduce repetitive communication and revision cycles; and suppliers gain
          immediate exposure to active projects, improving conversion opportunities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking ahead, the system will incorporate AI-enhanced features—such as a material recommendation engine tuned
          to style, budget, and project type; a sustainability scoring framework that integrates environmental impact
          and durability data; and preference-learning algorithms that personalize suggestions over time—to increase
          intelligence, sustainability, and user satisfaction.
